# Phone Simulator (Portfolio)

For the Phone Simulator, I combined 6 projects that we worked on during the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. The Phone Simulator displays the current time at the top of the "screen". Below that, there is a weather module that pulls realtime weather data based on your current location. Below the weather app is a countdown timer (currently set to countdown to my birthday â€” March 21st). Below the countdown timer are three applications:
* Calculator
* Todo List
* Mind Reader

For this project, I wanted to use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), as these are a feature of React that I was previously not too familiar with.
